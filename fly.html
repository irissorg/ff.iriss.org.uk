      <p><strong>It's time to spread your wings!</strong></p>

<p>In this section we'll be thinking about the future of care and support for older people in Scotland, and exploring what might need to happen to make sure we get there.</p>

<div class="fly-aside">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 2014, we asked key partners across care and support in Scotland to think about the future of care for older people. We wanted to build a vision for the future for policy, attitude and practice. <em>Fit for the Future</em> wants to build a culture where tomorrow matters just as much as today, and where we actively imagine and shape the future together.</p>

<p>We hope that you use this resource to prompt discussion and debate and to begin to think about making your own vision for the future a reality. While these responses may not represent a radical view of the future, they do reflect the mood of the moment for partners in care across Scotland. For something a little more radical you may want to look at <a href="http://content.iriss.org.uk/2025/"><em>Imagining the Future</em></a>.</p>

True integration of services and respect for each other is required. Building blocks of knowledge and education will help this rather than having Nurses, OTs, Support Workers etc. Have one title Health and Support Worker with the following modules of learning which may involve OT Module, Nursing Module, Physio module... Have a generic Health and Social Care worker, grade a, b, c etc with modules of learning who have the ability to meet the holistic outcomes for the individual with whom they work. Some of them may wish later on to specialise dependent upon the clients with whom they work. Let's lose the professional tunnel vision that prevents workers from meeting clients outcomes.</p>

Therefore an increasing older population is a success story, particularly in term of life expectancy and older people should be welcomed into different areas of society using their strengths where possible and protecting those who are more vulnerable... Staff should recognise the impact of normal ageing on ill health and vice versa while demonstrating positive attitudes towards older people irrespective of their health, social and psychological/mental health needs... Generic workers from a generic pot of money may be the way forward in  meeting  robust care needs.</p>
